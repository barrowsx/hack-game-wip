This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

beginnings of a frontend for a game i want to work on

currently on hold because i have to work on projects for school and don't have time

right now it has amazing features such as:

* fake windows(using react-desktop)
* fake dock(using react-apple-menu)
* fake terminal(using garbage code by me)
* real draggable fake windows(using react-draggable)
